## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on multi-class image classification of vehicles using deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

The goal is to correctly classify images into one of seven categories:

* Cars
* Bikes
* Motorcycles
* Planes
* Ships
* Trains
* Auto Rickshaws

The model is built using a pretrained EfficientNet architecture and fine-tuned for the task.

## 📊 Dataset

Dataset from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmaher5/vehicle-classification

### Key Characteristics:

* ~800 images per class
* ~5500+ total images
* Balanced dataset
* Size: ~1GB

⚠️ Dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Base Model:

* EfficientNetB0 (pretrained on ImageNet)

### Custom Head:

* GlobalAveragePooling
* Dropout (0.3)
* Dense layer (Softmax)

### Training Strategy:

1. Freeze base model → train classifier
2. Partial fine-tuning (last layers)

## 📈 Results

| Metric              | Value  |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| Training Accuracy   | 99.9%  |
| Validation Accuracy | 99.36% |

---

## ⚠️ Critical Observations

High accuracy may be influenced by:

* Dataset simplicity
* Visual differences between classes
* Potential similarity across splits

This highlights the importance of evaluating models on more diverse datasets.
